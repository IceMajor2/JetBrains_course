# hyperskill-projects
A collection of projects from [JetBrains Academy's courses on Hyperskill platform](https://hyperskill.org/categories/2).

The projects contained guidelines and instructions, but the implementation was left for the student.

The repository consists of a set of Java modules which are nothing else but the course projects. Each of the module is Gradle-/Maven-based what makes them easy to launch.
