# meal-planner
Some say that planning makes your management easier. If your current eating habits do not satisfy you, then giving a try to the **Meal Plannerâ„¢** may eventually turn out helpful.

## Use
The built-in command-line interface that will pop up in the program is pretty self-explanatory with 4 options: *add*, *plan*, *show*, *save* & *exit*.

## Build
As the application uses **PostgreSQL** for data storage, you'll have to first set it up.

Then, once you've acquired source code of the `meal-planner`, execute `mvn clean compile exec:java`.
